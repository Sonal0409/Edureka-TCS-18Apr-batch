
1. Become root user:

# sudo su -

2. Install git if on AWS ec2 instance

# yum install git -y

Above command not required on edureka Lab.

3. Create a Local repository using GIT

#  mkdir myproject

# cd myproject

# touch index1.html index2.html

# git init

A local repository will be created

# ls -al

.git folder will be available, which is your local repository.


4. Add the configuration parameters in git, which will later update author and email details in the git commit history

2 variables need to be set

user.name
user.email


# git config --global user.name sonal0409

# git config --global user.email admin@gmail.com

List the configurations:

git config --list

try it latter

git config --global --unset user.name


5. Add the files to the stagging area and commit them to Local repo
=========================================

# git status

# git add <filename> <filename2>

or

git add --all

or

git add .

or

git add *.java *.php

# git status

# git commit -m "adding file index1.html"

Commit all the changes/files in the stagging area

If we want to Choose a file to be commited

git commit -m "adding file index1.html" <filename>

================================================

6. Modify exisitng files and add chnages to local repo

Take a file which is in local repo

# git ls-files

# vim index1.html

add any data & save the file

# git status

status of file is modified

To add all the modification and commit them to local repo

# git commit -a -m "added modifications"


7. If some files are not required to be tracked by GIT --> ignore certain files for version control

=================================================

Git provides the concept of gitignore, wher ein we create a file with the name .gitignore


# vim .gitignore

In this file insert the name of files to be ingores

press i

*.txt
*.php
*.state

:wq

# git status

This concept this applicable to new file(files that are not commited)
It is only for untracked file.


8. How can GIT can ignore changes on tracked files for certian time.

GIT STASHING

============================================

If we have some incomplete work on tracked files, we can stash them in a temporary location and latter we can get them back to working directory

vim index1.html

press i

inster some new data

press esc key
:wq   and then enter key

# git status ==> you will see modiffied file

# git diff index1.html

Stash the modifications

# git stash

you can see the stash in .git==>refs==>stash folder

# git stash list

stash is saved a n array of index

stash name stash@{0}

see what saved in the stash 

# git show stash@{0}

================================================

19-Apr Notes
================================================

# sudo su -

# cd myproject

1. Check the log for commit history

# git log

in this HEAD it is an object in git which represents the latest/recent commit id

# git log --oneline

Check commit history of every commit in a single line

# git show <commid id>
Shows what happened in that commit.


2. Create a feature branch in git  and switch to the branch

========================================

# git branch

Create a new branch

# git branch feature1

Switch to the new branch

# git checkout feature1

[OR]

Create a new branch and switch to the branch also

# git checkout -b feature2

3. Merge the commits/files of new branch to master

Before merging always switch to the destination branch

# git checkout master

# git merge feature1 master

< git merge sourcebranch destinationbranch>


4. Delete a branch which is not merged with master branch

# git branch -D <branchname>

Delete a branch whose commits have been merged with the master branch

# git branch -d feature1


5. Reset the commit history

# git reset --hard <commitid>

here:

commit id is where the HEAD will point to now.

All the other commits above it will be deleted and the chnages will also be deleted from LR and working directory.

It is a destructive command


6. Rebase merging strategy in GIT (rewind the commit history)

# git branch

you should be on the master branch

Now create a new branch

# git branch feature1

On the master branch create 2  new commits

example of my log on master branch

8bce083 (HEAD -> master) on master branch 2
daa1204 on master branch1
ea61e8e (feature1) added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html


Now switch to feature branch and create 2 new commits


example of my log on master branch

9981946 (HEAD -> feature1) on branch
156dc12 done in feature branch
ea61e8e added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html


I want to rebase - re organise the base of my feature branch

Make sure you are on feature branch

# git rebase master


The commit history will be as such:

41f5d79 (HEAD -> feature1) on branch
9469e15 done in feature branch
8bce083 (master) on master branch 2
daa1204 on master branch1
ea61e8e added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html

=================================================

GITHUB:

==================================================

Login to github.com

============================


Personal access tokens (classic) function like ordinary OAuth access tokens. They can be used instead of a password for Git over HTTPS, or can be used to authenticate to the API over Basic Authentication.

1. Create a personal access token:

 > clcik on user menu which is on the extreme right
 > click on settings in that
 > scroll down, on left side you will see developer settings -- click on it
 > on left side 3 rd option --> personla Access token
 > select tokens(classic)
 > click on generate new token --> click on generate new token classic
 > in note --give token name as token19
 > expiration --> leave as is
 > select scopes --> clcik on repo checkbox
 > scroll down and clcik on generate token
 > the generated token need to be copied safely

token:

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 


2. Create a remote repository

3. Connect local repo to remote repo

# git checkout master

# git remote add origin https://github.com/Sonal0409/myproject19Apr.git

# git remote -v 

Remove origin if needed

# git remote rm origin


Push data from local to remote

# git push origin master

username : github
password: token

================================

Create a file in github on master branch and pull the file to merge in local repoisotry master branch


Once file is create don master branch of remote repo

go to local repo

# git checkout master

# git pull origin master

pull will fecth changes and merge them with LR and WD

================================


Clone a remote repository to local machine

# git clone https://github.com/Sonal0409/myproject19Apr.git


Forking - complete
===========================================

You will be on the jenkins dashboard



==============================================

jenkisn set up on edureka lab

java -version



 curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

Then add a Jenkins apt repository entry:
    
  echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

Update your local package index, then finally install Jenkins:


    
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install jenkins -y

systemctl start jenkins

==========================================

Jenkins Demo:

1. Create a Freestyle job in jenkins

2. Create a freestyle job and integrate it with GITHUB repostitory

Demo 1: Create a Jenkisn job that will clone a github repository in jenkins workspace

Create a new job in jenkins
Click on + sign to create new item/job/project
Give a name to the job : CloneRepo
Select freestyle project and click on OK button
On the project click on Source code management
Select git option
Give git hub repo path
https://github.com/Sonal0409/myproject05Aug

Branch name as ===>  Master

Save the job

Click on Build now

Repository will be cloned in jenkins workspace

You can go to job → workspace folder to see the files

3. Create a frestyle job and integrate it with Maven

MAVEN : 

> It is a powerful tool which helps in building, managing and documenting your project

> Maven by heart is a plugin based tool

> whenever a maven plugin or command is executed, its output will be stored in folder called target

> It has 2 types of plugins:

build plugins:

Task  						Plugin					GOAL/Commands 	output

Compile the code  			Compiler				mvn compile		class files

execute some Testcases		Surefire				mvn test		test passed/failed status

Package the code			package					mvn package     .war file

Clean the previous build	clean					mvn clean		clean up from target folder
files

Deploy artifact on 			deploy					mvn deploy
artifactory

install all dependencies	install					mvn install


In maven multiple goals can be executed together

# mvn clean install package

Reporting plugins:
==============================
Will always generate reports, and in maven the reports are mostly generated in the format : xml,html,txt

Task  						Plugin					GOAL/Commands 	output

Code Review					pmd						mvn pmd:pmd		pmd.xml report	

test reports				surefire				mvn test		surefire reports - xml,txt

Code coverage				JACOCO,sonarcube		mvn sonar:sonar



Structure MAVEN project

src/main/java   ==> source code will be present
src/test/java   ==> test cases will be present

pom.xml   ==> heart of maven project

 1. dependencies   ==> tools downloded by developer to write code
 2. plugin information

Demo 3: Jenkins + maven integration:

Jenkins--> Manage Jenkins-->Global Tool configuration



Under GIT==> leave it same 

Under maven ==> lets install it automatically
Type mymaven and check the install automatically box.
Save the changes


**********************************
Job Package Job
***************************

Go to jenkins--> new item--> Name= Package==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes
 
build ==> invoke top level maven target==>mymaven

 goal = clean install package

==> save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console

==> go to workspace ==> target/addressbook.war

==========================================================================

pipelines Using plugins are called as Plugin based pipelines or Upstream and downstream pipelines
These pipelines are created using freestyle jobs.

Jenkins allows us to create multiple task in one single job.

Whenever a user has to perfom set of tasks one after other (in a sequence) or in parallel, it can easily be done using 
pipleine template in jenkins

Pipleines in jenkins are nothing but set of task executed in sequence(by default) 

When a user is creating a pipeline we will have to write code for it.
The pipeline code is based on Groovy scripting which is Domain specific lanaguage
In jenkins pipeline code using 2 types of syntax

 > scripted pipeline syntax

> scripted pipeline syntax always starts with a keyword called as node
> When Jenkins version1 came in to the market, the admin used scripted pipeline syntax to write pipeline code
> scripted pipeline syntax is difficult to read and write.
> there is no structure or no definite style which writitng the code
> The code written scripted pipeline syntax is not validated by jenkins
> This syntax is no longer used
> if the pipeline fails, you have to run the pipeline from the begining

 > Declarative pipeline syntax

> Declarative pipeline syntax always starts with a keyword called as pipeline
> With jenkins version2, Declarative pipeline syntax was introduced
>This is well structured syntax, where user is provided with definite pipeline sections
> we need to just declare the pipeline code
> It declarative in nature, syntax is very simple
> if the pipeline failes, you can restart the pipeline form the point that it had failed previously
> Stages in pipeline means Job to be executed
> Every stage will have a Name in the pipeline, steps to be executed, post build steps, 
> jenkins provides a pipeline code snippet generator, that helps your to learn pipeline scripting

Syntax:  key 'value' 
for example: name 'Jenkins'
             sh 'echo "hello All"'

============================================================

1. It is better that you write your pipeline code in Github, so that many team members can collaborate to the pipeline
2. it allows version control the changes done on pipelines
3. How does jenkins read pipeline code form github

Using the concept of Jenkinsfile

It is a simple text file. it has no extention 
Name is preffered as Jenkinsfile
This is the file in which we will maintain pipeline code Version control
Jenkins--> pipelinetemplate--> fetch jenkins file--> execute pipeline code for you.
==========================================================

Master and slave Set up

Step 1: create a workder node (VM of type linux) on AWS

Step 2: Install git and java on worker node

# yum install git -y
# sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11

Step 3: Create remote root directory on the worker & give permissions for access

/tmp/jenkinsdir
chmod -R 777 /tmp/jenkinsdir

Step 4: Go to master machine and update Jenkins URL

Manage Jenkins> Configure System > update the jenkins URL to the current url > save the page


Step 5: On master machine open Agent port

Manage Jenkins> Configure Global Security> scroll down to agents > select random and save the page

Step 6: Configure worker node on master

Manage Jenkins> Manage nodes and clouds

Number of executors= executor = Job ==> 1
remote root directory : /tmp/jenkinsdir
label : linux_node
Usage: only build jobs with matching labels


Step 7: check if connection is succesfull

Step 8: add agent in the piepline
